# Note
SwiftUI is still in beta and I'm also still learning how it works.

To-Do:

- Pagination (No way to do it in SwiftUI currently)
- List doesn't let you remove the separators for now, so instead you have to use a ScrollView and add each view which isn't good since
ScrollView renders every element even if it's off screen.
- Test animations
